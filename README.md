<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/learn/lecture/7343034?start=15#overview">Becoming a WordPress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code</a>

<h3>Course Covers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why code is the key to building whatever you can imagine with WordPress</li>
<li>The ability to write PHP to manipulate the data of a WordPress site</li>
<li>The ability to write JavaScript to add on-the-fly interactivity to a WordPress site</li>
<li>How to code your own new custom block types for the "Gutenberg" Block Editor</li>
<li>The skills, knowledge and vocabulary to work professionally as a WordPress developer</li>
</ul>

<p>Credit to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/bradschiff/">Brad Schiff</a> for developing and presenting an excellent course which brings WordPress to life.</p>

<p>The material herein varies from the course material in two important ways: (1) the developer chose to vary from the theme structure for menus, keeping them as an adjustable theme feature, and (2) the developer chose different content and focus for many of the website pages and posts.</p>
